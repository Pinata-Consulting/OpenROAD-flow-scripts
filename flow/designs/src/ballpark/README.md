Ballpark estimates
==================

Software engineers can approach hardware engineers with questions to try to build some sort of intuitive understanding of the constraints of hardware.

These seemingly simple questions are not easy to answer.

Within a cycle:

- How far can a signal travel?
- What is the maximum fan out of a flip-flop to other flip-flops?
