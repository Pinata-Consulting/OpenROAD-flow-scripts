# Environment Variables for the OpenROAD Flow Scripts


Environment variables are used in the OpenROAD flow to define various
platform, design and tool specific variables to allow finer control and
user overrides at various flow stages. These are defined in the
`config.mk` file located in the platform and design specific directories.

## Platform

These variables must be defined in the platform specific config file
located in the OpenROAD-flow-scripts directory of
`./flow/platforms/<PLATFORM>/config.mk`

Note: The variable `PLATFORM_DIR` is set by default based on the `PLATFORM`
variable. For OpenROAD Flow Scripts we have the following public platforms:

-   `sky130hd`
-   `sky130hs`
-   `nangate45`
-   `asap7`

## Platform Specific Environment Variables


The table below lists the complete set of variables used in each of the
public platforms supported by the OpenROAD flow.


Note:
-   = indicates default definition assigned by the tool
-   ?= indicates that the variable value may be reassigned with design `config.mk`

## Design Specific Configuration Variables


### Required Variables

Required variables must be defined in the design configuration
file for each design located in the OpenROAD-flow-scripts directory of
`./flow/designs/<PLATFORM>/<DESIGN_NAME>/config.mk`

### Optional Variables

These are optional variables that may be over-ridden/appended with
default value from the platform `config.mk` by defining in the design
configuration file.

| DFF_LIB_FILES | Technology mapping liberty files for flip-flops. |

| FLOORPLAN_DEF | Use the DEF file to initialize floorplan. |
| GDS_FILES | Path to platform GDS files. |
| GENERATE_ARTIFACTS_ON_FAILURE | For instance Bazel needs artifacts (.odb and .rpt files) on a failure to allow the user to save hours on re-running the failed step locally, but when working with a Makefile flow, it is more natural to fail the step and leave the user to manually inspect the logs and artifacts directly via the file system. Set to 1 to change the behavior to generate artifacts upon failure to e.g. do a global route. The exit code will still be non-zero on all other failures that aren't covered by the "useful to inspect the artifacts on failure" use-case. Example: just like detailed routing, a global route that fails with congestion, is not a build failure(as in exit code non-zero), it is a successful(as in zero exit code) global route that produce reports detailing the problem. Detailed route will not proceed, if there is global routing congestion This allows build systems, such as bazel, to create artifacts for global and detailed route, even if the operation had problems, without having know about the semantics between global and detailed route. Considering that global and detailed route can run for a long time and use a lot of memory, this allows inspecting results on a laptop for a build that ran on a server. |
